# Dark_Overlords
This is a learning platform I have designed with the aim of removing all the huddles newbies face while learning
Ethical Hacking and Bug Hunting. I am going to be using a project based methodology to learn and teach Ethical Hacking 
and bug bounty. I have clearly outlined my learning methodology in an article on medium.com title "The Lazy Method
I Use To Learn Hacking", this will be the same methodology I use in this platform.

The notes in this platform are a guide to how I approach targets and my decision making process during any engagement
they are not solid facts and feel free to play around with different approaches. After all we are all learning.
